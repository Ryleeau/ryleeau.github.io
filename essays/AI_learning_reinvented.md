## Introduction

AI, or Artificial Intelligence has transformed learning, enriching the student learning experience by providing tools and techniques. These tools and techniques optimize time and bridge the gap between the learning and the working sides of software engineering. In software engineering, AI automates repetitive tasks, in that it provides intelligent analysis that contributes to a software engineer's productivity and creativity. Some AI concepts and tools include machine learning, automated testing, and collaboration tools like Liveshare in vscode. I personally use ChatGPT to enhance my software engineering learning.


## Personal Experience with AI

Experience WODs: For the E20 Experience Functional Programming 3, I asked ChatGPT "Write a function using array functional methods that [(https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f24/morea/typescript-3/experience-functional-programming-3.html)](pasted two function explanations)." The result was similar to what I needed except for certain syntax erros I needed to fix.

In-class Practice WODs: I pasted the instructions into ChatGPT to see what it would give me. Most times it would result in a lot of syntax errors.

In-class WODs: Similar to the In-class practice WODs, I pasted the instructions into ChatGPT to see what it would give me. Most times it would result in a lot of syntax errors. I noticed that AI most definitely helped with the structure of the code, but I needed to generally know the skills in order to fix the errors.

Essays: I chose not to use AI for essays since I thought essays would make more sense if it came from me since most of the essays were tailored to personal experience.

Final project: I used ChatGPT to provide me ideas of the mockup pages given some guidelines I liked from the web but weren't quite what I wanted. I would not have been able to produce the mockups I had in mind if it wasn't for AI since the alternative was just creating the pages without the mockups.

Learning a concept / tutorial: I used ChatGPT by asking "provide me an example of x concept." It definitely helped me understand the general idea and steps to the concept. However, I noticed that sometimes ChatGPT would give me a wrong answer or a wrong step, so I had to make sure I referenced with website examples.

Answering a question in class or in Discord: I did not use AI for this since I feel that I am good at asking questions and being articulate in my issues. I often provide images of issues when I needed help from a teacher as well.

Asking or answering a smart-question: I did not use AI for this since I had little need to only communicate through discord or online. When I had an issue with ruby in the github configuration for the professional portfolio, I met with my professor to get this figured out.

## Conclusion

Design patterns are the architectural blueprints of software engineering, guiding developers to efficient and usable systems. Just as architects design buildings with structural integrity, developers use design patterns to construct code that is flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain. They bridge the gap between abstract concepts and practical solutions, transforming potential chaos into orderly systems.
