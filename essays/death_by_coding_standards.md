Ever since I was young, I have always been interested in computer science and STEM. A big part of my interest originated from the fact that there are not a lot of women in STEM. I want to be a part of something niche and difficult, but also equally rewarding. I love that being a minority in a male-dominated career field makes me another contact and hopefully a future mentor to other women like me.

I have a very basic experience with website development from high school, but I am excited to refresh my Javascript skills and develop a public profile. Since I am in the Air Force, I am not expecting to look for a computing job until around a decade from now when I leave. However, I am glad to learn Software Engineering and take this course through University of Hawaii at Manoa for the Fall 2024 semester to create a professional digital footprint.

At my time at University of Hawaii at Manoa, I am hoping to learn a strong basis in Software Engineering. By the time I am done with this course, I hope I learn and practice skill development to take the next step in my life as a developer. I have so much to learn and I hope to continue to advance my understanding and remain a life-long learner.
