Having learned Javascript in high school, learning python freshman year of college, and moving on to C for sophomore year of college, it is safe to say that I have not used Javascript in a while. Now, with the addition of Typescript, even though it is an extension of Javascript, it is very safe to say that I am confused. With all the different coding styles in my head, I notice that I am constantly getting syntax mixed up. Is Typescript really worth it?

Typescript is not a good or bad programming language. It is simply just another language with all its quirks and special features. One quirk is the explicit declaration of variable types. Though useful in the sense of knowing what types to input and output in a function, it feels a little tedious and requires a lengthier line of code. However, Typescript does take the win for software engineering due to the good command over component behavior and data types.

As a newbie in the software engineering realm, I concede that I need to work on effective and efficient AI usage. Practice WODs stress me out due to my coding style confusion and my AI uncomfortability. The fact that AI makes me uncomfortable is exactly why I should be using it more and why I believe learning software engineering will be powerful.
