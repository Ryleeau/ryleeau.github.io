In the wordle game I created, the user can choose the mode of difficulty (easy, medium, hard) which relate to the number of letters in the word (5,6,7). This chooses the word from one of the three separate txt files of listed words based on modes. The user places an initial guess. Comparing the guess and the actual word, if the letter is in the right place it will print the letter in green to console. If the letter is in the word but not in the right place it will print the letter in red to console. If the letter is not in the word at all it will print in black to console.

I coded this game without any AI usage and with minimal assistance from my instructor. I completed this final project in the CS220 Programming Fundamentals class at the United States Air Force Academy. 

I learned how to create a game printed to the console, developing my fundamental C programming skills. I had to be patient with all the errors and issues I ran into, furthering my perseverance and determination to complete the game development. I now know how to print color to the console and how to frequently problem solve.
